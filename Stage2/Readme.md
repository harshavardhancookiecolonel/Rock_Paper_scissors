DESCRIPTION:

Well, now let's do something more tangible. Nobody wants to play the game where you always lose. We can use the power of the random module to make the game a bit more challenging.

Write a program that reads input from users, chooses a random option, and then says who won: a user or the computer.

There are a few examples below to provide the output for any outcome (<option> is the option chosen by your program):

Loss: Sorry, but the computer chose <option>;

Draw: There is a draw (<option>);

Win: Well done. The computer chose <option> and failed;

OBJECTIVES:

Your program should:

Read the user input that includes an option;

Choose a random option;

Compare the options and determine the winner;

Output one of the lines above depending on the result of the game.

EXAMPLES:

> rock

Well done. The computer chose scissors and failed

> scissors

There is a draw (scissors)

> paper

Sorry, but the computer chose scissors
