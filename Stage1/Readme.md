OBJECTIVES:

Write a program that reads input that states which option users have chosen. After this, your program must make users lose! That is, your program should always select an option that defeats the one picked by users. Once it finds this option, output the line Sorry, but the computer chose <option>, where <option> is the name of the option that the program's picked depending on the user's input.
For example, if users enter rock, the program should print Sorry, but the computer chose paper and so on.

Pay attention to the format of the output. It should follow the one in the example, including capital letters and punctuation. Do not print additional strings.

Just think about it: in this stage, the computer has to win every time.

if users choose paper, the computer chooses scissors (the computer wins);

if users choose scissors, the computer chooses rock (the computer wins);

if users choose rock, the computer chooses paper (the computer wins).

EXAMPLES:

> scissors

Sorry, but the computer chose rock

> paper

Sorry, but the computer chose scissors
