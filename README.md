# Rock_Paper_scissors

Rock paper scissors is a popular hand game. Two players simultaneously form one of three shapes with their hands, and then, depending on the shapes, one player wins â€” rock beats scissors, paper wins over rock, scissors defeats paper. 
The game is well-known for fair win-conditions between equal options.
